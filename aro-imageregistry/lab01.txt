1. Check existing ImageStreams:

	oc get imagestreams



2. Create an ImageStream from a file:



First, you would have a YAML file, let's say nginx-is.yaml, with the following content:



apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: false




oc create -f nginx-is.yaml




3. Describe the newly created ImageStream:

	oc describe imagestream nginx


4. Import the official NGINX image from Docker Hub into the new ImageStream:

	oc import-image nginx --from=docker.io/library/nginx:latest --confirm


5. List all ImageStreams again to verify:

	oc get imagestreams


6. Tag the imported image to a new version tag:

	oc tag nginx:latest nginx:v1


7. Trigger a new import (assuming there's an update in the source image):

	oc import-image nginx



8. Export the ImageStream to a file:

	oc get imagestream nginx -o yaml > exported-nginx.yaml

Now you would have an exported-nginx.yaml file with the ImageStream definition.


9. Assuming you made some changes in exported-nginx.yaml, apply those changes:

	oc apply -f exported-nginx.yaml


10. Finally, once you're done testing or if you want to clean up, delete the ImageStream:

	oc delete imagestream nginx
